A machine learning project to predict house prices using Python and Scikit-Learn.

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing 2,919 property records with the following key features:

MSSubClass: Building class
MSZoning: General zoning classification
LotArea: Lot size in square feet
LotConfig: Lot configuration
BldgType: Type of dwelling
OverallCond: Overall condition rating (1-10)
YearBuilt: Original construction year
YearRemodAdd: Remodel date
Exterior1st: Exterior covering
BsmtFinSF2: Type 2 finished basement area (sq ft)
TotalBsmtSF: Total basement area (sq ft)
SalePrice: Target variable (to be predicted)
🛠 Technologies Used Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning library) Jupyter Notebook (Optional for exploration) OpenPyXL (Excel file handling)

📋 Future Improvements Hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance Feature engineering to create new predictive variables Experiment with gradient boosting models (XGBoost, LightGBM) Develop a Streamlit web application for interactive predictions
